========================================
HOW TO USE:
========================================

DNA ANALYSIS:
1. Go to "DNA Analysis" tab
2. Enter investigator and sample name
3. Upload file or paste sequence
4. Click "Analyze DNA Sample"
5. View results with blood group and characteristics

GEL ANALYSIS:
1. Go to "Gel Analysis" tab
2. Upload first gel image
3. Click "Analyze Gel Image"
4. (Optional) Upload second image to compare
5. Compare lanes or generate report

BLOOD GROUP:
- Automatically detected with DNA analysis
- Shows ABO type, Rh factor, compatibility

========================================
TROUBLESHOOTING:
========================================

If old features are showing:
1. Close ALL browser tabs
2. Stop Python (Ctrl+C in terminal)
3. Run START_APP.bat
4. Open NEW browser tab
5. Go to http://localhost:5000

If confidence is still low:
- Use longer DNA sequences (>500 base pairs)
- Ensure sequence has good quality (balanced ACGT)
- Check that sequence is valid DNA (only ACGT characters)
